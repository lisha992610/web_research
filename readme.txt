In order to run the code, the packages need to be installed under python 3.6

The parsingWebsites.py will read the keywords from keyword.csv and write the number of result into recording.csv

Be careful: don't run the code too many times, The google noticed and forbidded the robot search.

My current ip addresse is already blocked by google. (nothing bad, just can not get any result from the code)
